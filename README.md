# rockPaperScissors

Second TOP project!

Very exsited for this one as it will include some much loved javascript. Finished what was asked of me for now, the entire game is working on the console and has no GUI yet. Will update soon once the lesson arrives. 



GUI update! Was a lot more difficult than I thought lol but managed to make a half decent working game! I fumbled a bit with the commit frequency and quality but will do better next time!
